    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to create a view that has at least one record per quarter for each person in our cross-reference file.  Since our synthetic UI wage file covers Q1 2017 through Q1 2021, each SSN will end up with at least 17 records because we have 17 quarters of wage data. Even people who were rarely employed or never employed should end up with at least 17 records; any quarter with no UI wage data will have 0 earnings amounts imputed. People who worked more than one job in any quarter will have more than 17 records. This will be accomplished with a 3 part join.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a data view that contains all of the UI wage data PLUS ZERO wages for any quarters in which the participant didn't work at all. At start those quarters of unemployment are completely missing from UI wage data files. However, it is important to account for people who never held a UI-covered job in the data to accurately estimate employment rates and earnings amounts. To do this, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAdd participants from our cross reference file (“XRef”) who never worked at all to the wage view that we are creating. The synthetic cross reference file includes identifying information for everyone in our caseload of interest. However, The UI wage file (“UI”) includes only program clients who worked in a UI-covered job during the follow-up period. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tAdd records for individuals on the UI wage data file who did not work every quarter. The UI wage file includes earnings for individuals only for the quarters in which they worked at a UI-covered job. At the beginning of the coding process, those who never worked have zero records, those who worked only 2 quarters for 1 employer have only 2 records, and those who worked only 1 year for 1 employer have only 4 records (1 for each quarter of employment). Those who worked for 2 employers during same quarter will have 2 records for that quarter. At the end, we will have a view with 17 quarters of data for everyone in the program.\n"
