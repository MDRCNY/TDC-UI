    "## Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we created quarterly and annual employment and earning measures. The purpose of this notebook is to calculate the length of time individuals spent being employed with any employer or  not employed. Consecutive quarters of employment or non-employment are known as “spells”. Given that the data are quarterly and an individual can be employed, unemployed, and then reemployed within the same quarter or between two consecutive quarters, these are somewhat rough estimates of continuous employment.  Looking at the quarters following the client's program start, we want to determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThe length of the longest employment spell with any employer: for how many continuous quarters did the client have reported earnings during the 3 years AFTER program enrollment? We consider someone to be continuously employed even if they change employers within the quarter or between quarters. For example, someone who was employed through January 10 (Q1) with one employer, then was unemployed for a few months, and then gets another job with a different employer starting April 28 (Q2) would be considered continuously employed.\n",
    "2.\tThe length of the longest spell of unemployment: for how many continuous quarters did the client have no reported earnings during the 3 years AFTER the program start quarter.\n",
    "3.\tWhether each person has any employment spells lasting 4 or more consecutive quarters."

    "#### Starting point \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are interested in the follow-up period after program enrollment, we do not include the quarter of program enrollment (relative quarter 0) in these measures, so we start with relative quarter 1. We want to follow the client for 3 years, so we will use 12 quarters of wage data. Below, we show what this looks like for the first two people in our input file (see first 24 rows of results). Notice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tWe kept only the quarters 1-12 after program start date.\n",
    "2.\tWe already have a binary (0/1) column (QTR_Employed) that tells us whether the client was employed in the quarter.\n",
    "3.\tTo calculate spells of continuous employment, it is important to order the rows sequentially by relative quarter (RelativeQTR).\n",
    "4.\tTo calculate how long employment or unemployment spells lasted, we need to know the values of the records before and after any particular quarterly record..\n",
    "5.\tLooking at the values of QTR_Employed, we see that the first person’s (SSN 100000000) longest employment spell was 2 quarters (relative quarters 7-8), and longest unemployment spell was 5 quarters (relative quarters 2-6). The second person’s (SSN 100090056) longest employment spell was 4 quarters (relative quarters 8-11) and longest unemployment spell was 5 quarters (relative quarters 3-7)."
