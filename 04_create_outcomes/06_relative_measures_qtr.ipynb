    "Analysis questions often focus on what happened after  a certain event, such as enrollment in a program. This code will create quarterly employment and earnings measures for the quarter of program enrollment and each quarter afterwards. These are called \"relative\" measures because they are relative to the date of enrollment, unlike the simple calendar measures we created in the 04_calendar_measures_qtr notebook\n",

Printed below are 6 quarters of data: the quarter just before program enrollment, the quarter of program enrollment, and 4 quarters after program enrollment.

However, many of the measures we have created are relative measures that are coded the same way for each time point, and you may want to follow employment trends for people over many years. To create a relative measure for a 3-year follow-up period, for example, would take 36 lines of logic and summation code. This section demonstrates how to generate and run automated SQL queries and creates relative quarterly measures dynamically.\n",

By using this iterative variable, the only thing that changes in each line is the value of the relative quarter.
