    "## Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook (06_relative_measures_qtr), we created quarterly employment and earning measures that were relative to the program enrollment quarter. The purpose of this notebook is similar to the previous one, except here we create annual relative measures. This code will create measures using the data for the 4 quarters (relative year) after program enrollment. Reminder that these are called \"relative\" measures because they are relative to the enrollment year, unlike the simple calendar measures we created in the 05_calendar_measures_annual notebook. We create annual relative measures that correspond with the annual calendar measures we created previously: any employment, average quarterly employment, and annual earnings. We also create measures that can reflect employment stability or advancement, including whether someone earned more than $3500 in any quarter over the course of a year, or, for people with enough follow-up data, whether their earnings increased over time."

    "Our source file for these relative measures already has a record for every possible quarter in our follow-up period. Each record has information about the earnings reported, a yes/no indicator of employment (0/1), and the number of employers who reported earnings for the person during the quarter. We will keep and use only the quarter just before program enrollment, the quarter of program enrollment, and 4 quarters after program enrollment. We have already created a column (RelativeQTR) that indicates how close each quarter is to the client's program enrollment, but we need to add a column that groups four quarters together because we want \"relative yearly\" measures.\n",

    "1.\tThe first client below enrolled in the program in quarter 2 of 2017 (06/01/2017)\n",
    "2.\tEarnings reported in quarter 1 of 2017 (1 quarter prior to enrollment) are assigned the RelativeQTR value of -1\n",
    "3.\tEarnings reported in quarter 2 of 2017 (the first quarter enrolled) are assigned the RelativeQTR value of 0. This client has data for 15 quarters post-program enrollment.\n",
    "4.\tThe second client below enrolled in the program in quarter 1 of 2017\n",
    "5. Quarter 1 of 2017 is the first quarter of UI wage data we received. Therefore, we have no data for the quarter before program enrollment and no record with RelativeQTR value -1 for the second client."

However, many of the measures we have created are yearly measures that are coded the same way for each time point, and you may want to follow employment trends for people over many years. To create 5 measures for a 4 year follow-up period would take many lines of logic and summation code. This section demonstrates how to generate and run automated SQL queries and create relative annual measures dynamically.\n",

Below, we find the highest (or maximum) quarterly earnings during the first year of the program and compare it to the highest quarterly earnings during the fourth year. We create a variable storing the difference between the earnings (ChangeY1ToY4) and a binary variable for whether the difference is greater than $250 (ChngY1Y4GE250)."
