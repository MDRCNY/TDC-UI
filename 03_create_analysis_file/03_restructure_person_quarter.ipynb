    "## Purpose \n",
    "In the previous notebook (02_link_TANF_UI), we joined our TANF sample definition file to our UI wage data and created a person-quarter-level view of the data, called UIFULLV. The purpose of this notebook is to create a new view with only one record per person per quarter from UIFULLV. For each person, we will create a measure of total earnings in each quarter by summing records if the person has multiple employers in a quarter, and create a count of the number of employers the person has in each quarter. We will also look at quarterly earnings relative to the person’s participation in the program.on.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we create a “relative quarter” column that represents the number of quarters that have passed after a specific reference date (in this case, after someone started a program)  In the code below, the relative quarter represents the number of quarters that have elapsed since participants started the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, we sum the number of employers and earnings per quarter for each person on the data file. For example, if someone worked for 2 different employers in the same quarter, we sum the wage amounts and count the employer IDs so that for each quarter, we know a person’s total earnings and how many jobs they held.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For people with no earnings in a quarter, we assume that they were not employed in a UI-covered job for that quarter. People who have a positive earnings amount were employed at some point during the quarter. We use that information to create a 0/1 employment indicator column, where 0 indicates no employment and 1 indicates that the person was employed during the quarter.\n",
