    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this code is to join the simulated UI wage records file from a state department of labor to a TANF sample definition file (which we named XRef). The sample definition file includes some of the information from what is typically included in a full TANF cross-reference file, which links individual-level identifiers (like SSNs) to TANF case information. In this scenario, the file contains a list of identifiers for all of our sample members with a program start and end date We use SSNs to link the two files (XRef dataset and UI dataset) so that everyone in our sample is included in the resulting file, even if they did not appear in the UI wage data file. You will need adults who did not work in any particular quarter in your data view so that you can account for non-employment in specific quarters when creating your employment-related measures. Since UI wage records files are typically be structured as one record per individual-quarter-employer, linking the two files creates a view that has at least one wage record per quarter for each person in our cross-reference file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our simulated sample includes adult TANF recipients who entered the program between January 2017 and December 2020, and we have simulated quarterly wage data for the period Q1 2017 - Q1 2021. Since our simulated UI wage data file covers Q1 2017 through Q1 2021, each SSN will end up with at least 17 records because there are 17 quarters in this follow-up period. Even people who were rarely employed or never employed should end up with at least 17 records; any quarter with no UI wage data will have 0 earnings amounts imputed. People who worked more than one job in any quarter will have more than 17 records. This will be accomplished with a 3 part join: first, we join the TANF cross-reference file to the distinct quarters on the UI wage data file to produce a file (or view) in which each person in our sample has at least 1 record per quarter. Then, we join the resulting data set to the full set of data on UI wage data file.\n"

ProgStart is the date the client started in the program and ProgEnd is the date the client left the program.\n"
