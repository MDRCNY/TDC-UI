# Overview of Resources for the UI Wage Data Toolkit and Related TDC Materials 

This folder includes resources that users of the UI wage data toolkit may find helpful. It covers a variety of topics, including equity, data security, and programming and data QC tips. It also serves as a place for our team to continue to post information that the TDC pilot sites found useful during our partnerships with them. If you have suggestions or would like to see a resource here that we have not included, we would love to hear from you! Please email any ideas to cdicode@mdrc.org.
