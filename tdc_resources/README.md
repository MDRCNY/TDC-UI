# Overview of Resources for the UI Wage Data Toolkit and Related TDC Materials 

This folder includes resources that users of the UI wage data toolkit may find helpful. It covers a variety of topics, including equity, data security, and programming and data QC tips. It also serves as a place for our team to continue to post information that the TDC pilot sites found useful during our partnerships with them. 

This folder also includes a subdirectory of sustainability resources that accompanies “Strengthening Analytics in Government Agencies: A Toolkit for Sustainable Data Use.” These documents are meant to be referenced alongside the Toolkit and serve as helpful resources for agencies working on building sustainable data capacity.

If you have suggestions or would like to see a resource here that we have not included, we would love to hear from you! Please email any ideas to cdicode@mdrc.org.
