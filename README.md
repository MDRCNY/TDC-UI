# TANF Data Collaborative UI Wage Data Toolkit
This repository accompanies the TANF Data Collaborative (TDC) UI Wage Data Toolkit [INSERT LINK] and shares resources for program administrators and researchers preparing employment data from state Unemployment Insurance (UI) systems for analysis.

For more information about how to prepare TANF data for analysis, see [the TANF data model developed by Chapin Hall](https://www.chapinhall.org/wp-content/uploads/IB_FSSDC_082917.pdf). 

## About TDC and the TDC Toolkit
TDC is an initiative of ACF's TANF Data Innovation (TDI) project, launched in late 2017 to accelerate the use of TANF administrative data for program improvement and evidence building at the federal, state and local level. TDI is sponsored by the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation (OPRE) in collaboration with the Office of Family Assistance (OFA), in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). MDRC is the lead organization and is joined by leading experts in public data governance and analysis, including Actionable Intelligence for Social Policy (AISP) at the University of Pennsylvania, the Coleridge Initiative, Chapin Hall, and Public Strategies. 

The TDC Toolkit was developed through a collaborative process between TDC partners and local TANF agency staff, researchers, and policy experts. The Toolkit builds on decades of experience acquiring, linking, processing, and analyzing UI data and represents a culmination of the joint energy and effort of these many contributors. It addresses a variety of common challenges, from approaching real or perceived legal barriers to data access and establishing a governance structure, to selecting a data linkage method and then analyzing the linked data to produce actionable insights. Further guidance on TANF data-specific topics can be found on [TDC's website](https://www.tanfdata.org/content/tanf-data-model?category%5B%5D=3).
