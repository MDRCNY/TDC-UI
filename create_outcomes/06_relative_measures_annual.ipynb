    "\n",
    "Our source file for these relative measures already has a record for every possible quarter a person could be employed. Each record has information about the earnings reported, a yes/no indicator of employment, and the number of employers who reported earnings for the person during the quarter. We will keep and use only the quarter just before program enrollment, the quarter of program enrollment, and 4 quarters after program enrollment. We have already created a column (RelativeQTR) that indicates how close each quarter is to the client's program enrollment, but we need to add a column that groups the quarters in years because we want \"relative yearly\" measures.\n",

    "Let's take a look at the transaction file that we will use as input and view all records for the first client (17 total) and the first record for the second client. Notice:\n",
    "1. The first client below enrolled in the program in quarter 2 of 2017 (06/01/2017)\n",
    "2. Earnings reported in quarter 1 of 2017 (1 quarter prior to enrollment) are assigned the RelativeQTR value of -1\n",
    "3. Earnings reported in quarter 2 of 2017 (the first quarter enrolled) are assigned the RelativeQTR value of 0\n",
    "4. The second client below enrolled in the program in quarter 1 of 2017\n",
    "5. Quarter 1 of 2017 is the first quarter of UI wage data we received. Therefore, we have no data for the quarter before this client started the program and there is no record with RelativeQTR value -1 for the second client."

    "## Automating the code above\n",
    "\n",
    "The code presented above has been written manually for demonstration purposes. However, many of the measures we have created are yearly measures that are coded the same way for each time snapshot, and you may want to follow longer-term employment trends for people over many years. To create 5 measures for a 4 year follow-up period would have us typing many more lines of logic and summation code. This section demonstrates how to generate and run automated SQL queries and creates relative annual measures dynamically. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of SQL coding is known as **Dynamic SQL**.  The result of our coding will be a query that can be run (or executed). So, we are not looking to generate SQL result sets below, rather we are generating SQL query code. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note about Dynamic SQL: \n",
    "*Jupyter Notebooks, the file type we are using to share this code, does not support dynamic SQL code. The code below therefore produces errors when it is executed here. To use this code, you should copy and paste it into your respective SQL Server software.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the Create View code above that created 2 years of earning and employment measures but suppose you wanted  all the years we had data for. Notice that all the lines above are similar but   \n",
    "1. The value that the WHEN clause test changes for every relative year: 1, 2\n",
    "2. The name of measure being created changes for every relative year: EARNy1, EMPy1, EARNy2, EMPy2 ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the distinct values of the relative year variable will be stored in a iterative variable (@i) to drive the creation of our SQL query. By using this iterative variable, the only thing that changes on each line is value of the relative year. The value of the year is tested in the WHEN clause and is suffixed at the end of the column names."

    "\n",
    "We are often interested in comparing a client's quarterly earnings in the first year in the program to later years following program participation. A common approach is to look at the change in maximum quarterly earnings after four years of program participation. Below, we find the highest (or maximum) quarterly earnings during the first year of the program and compare it to the highest quarterly earnings during the fourth year. We create a variable storing the difference between the earnings (ChangeY1ToY4) and a 1/0 variable for whether the difference is greater than $250 (ChngY1Y4GE250)."
