    "Analysis questions often focus on what happened after the client enrolled in the program.

Printed below are 6 quarters of data: the quarter just before program enrollment, the quarter of program enrollment, and 4 quarters after program enrollment. The source file already has a column (RelativeQTR), created in the 02_restructure_person_quarter file, that indicates how close each quarter is to the client's program enrollment date.\n",

    "## Automating the code above\n",
    "\n",
    "The code presented above has been written manually for demonstration purposes. However, many of the measures we have created are relative measures that are coded the same way for each time snapshot, and you may want to follow longer-term employment trends for people over many years. To create one relative measure for a 3-year follow-up period, for example, would have us typing 36 lines of logic and summation code. This section demonstrates how to generate and run automated SQL queries and creates relative quarterly measures dynamically. \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of SQL coding is known as **Dynamic SQL**.  The result of our coding will be a query that can be run (or executed). So, we are not looking to generate SQL result sets below, rather we are generating SQL query code. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note about Dynamic SQL: \n",
    "*Jupyter Notebooks, the file type we are using to share this code, does not support dynamic SQL code. The code below therefore produces errors when it is executed here. To use this code, you should copy and paste it into your respective SQL Server software.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the Create View code above that created 5 quarters of earning and employment measures. Suppose you wanted to create measures for all the quarters we have data for. Notice that all the lines above are similar to the ones below, but below,   \n",
    "1. The value that the WHEN clause tests changes for every relative quarter: 0,1,2,3,4\n",
    "2. The name of the measure created changes for every relative quarter: EARN0, EMP0, EARN1, EMP1 ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the distinct relative quarter values will be stored in a variable to drive the creation of our SQL query. By using this iterative variable, the only thing that changes in each line is value of the relative quarter. The value of the relative quarter is tested in the WHEN clause and is suffixed at the end of the column names."
