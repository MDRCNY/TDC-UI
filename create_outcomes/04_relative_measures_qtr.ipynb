    "Analysis questions often focus on what happened after the client enrolled in the program. This code will create a number of measures that start the quarter the client enrolled in the program and follow the quarters after. These are sometimes called \"relative\" measures because they are relative to the enrollment quarter. Some example measures include:\n",

    "2. How much did the client earn the quarter of enrollement and then the quarters after enrollment? \n",

Each record has information about the earnings reported, a yes/no (0/1) indicator of employment, and the number of employers who reported earnings for the person during the quarter. Printed below are 6 quarters of data: the quarter just before program enrollment, the quarter of program enrollment, and 4 quarters after program enrollment. The source file already has a column (RelativeQTR), created in the 02_restructure_person_quarter file, that indicates how close each quarter is to the client's program enrollment date.\n",

    "2. Earnings reported in quarter 1 of 2017 (1 quarter prior to enrollment) are assigned the RelativeQTR value of -1\n",
