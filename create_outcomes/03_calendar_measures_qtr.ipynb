However, many of the measures we have created are quarterly measures that are coded the same way for each time snapshot, and you may want to follow longer-term employment trends for people over many years. To create one quarterly measure for a 3-year follow-up period, for example, would have us typing 36 lines of logic and summation code. This section demonstrates how to generate and run automated SQL queries and creates calendar quarterly measures dynamically. \n",

By using this iterative variable, the only thing that changes in each line is value of the quarter.
