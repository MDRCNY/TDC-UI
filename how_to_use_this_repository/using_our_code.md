### Using our Synthetic Data

### Modifying the SQL Server Connection

### Modifying the SQL Statements
To demonstrate output, our code will sometimes perform a processing step only on the first few records (using a SELECT TOP 10 clause in the SQL statement, for example). When processing your own data, use a CREATE TABLE or CREATE VIEW clause instead to create a new dataset complete with the processing changes.

### Dynamic SQL code chunks

## Using R Markdown
R Markdown is a file format for making dynamic and easy-to-read documents with R. An R Markdown document is written in markdown (a plain text format) and contains chunks of embedded R code. This allows you to show your code, output, and any explanatory text you might want in one clean document.
See R Studio's guide on getting started here: [R Markdown Introduction](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

The [data_quality_checks folder](https://github.com/MDRCNY/TDC-UI/tree/main/data_quality_checks) contains an R Markdown with R code with common checks performed on UI data. The folder contains a separate [instructions file](https://github.com/MDRCNY/TDC-UI/blob/main/data_quality_checks/instructions.md) with the steps required to use the files in that particular folder.
